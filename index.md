## My "DEV" side

My experience spans multiple programming languages and frameworks, including JavaScript, React,NodeJS and Python.


I like collaborating as a team player or leader, but as a freelancer I've also managed projects solo: 
Coverting sometimes-blurry project requirements to a detailed system design, 
pushing it from zero to production and working my way through various environments and constaints.


## My "Social" side

I'm currently studying as an M.A Political Science Student in Tel-Aviv University.
I'm a research assistant at [INES](https://socsci4.tau.ac.il/mu2/ines/) (Israel National Election Studies) 
and in another group which studies [populism](https://www.orendanieli.com/research#:~:text=%22Decomposing%20the%20Rise%20of%20the%20Populist%20Radical%20Right%22%20with%20Noam%20Gidron%2C%20Shinnosuke%20Kikuchi%2C%20and%20Ro%27ee%20Levy).


I've previously worked in Shrinking the Conflict Initiative, 
a project that aimed to impact policy and public opinion for improving the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict.


Working on an ambitious project that combines technology and social impact?

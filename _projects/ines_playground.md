The purpose of this interface is to allow easy access to the INES data. You can use it to plot the distributions of individual variables included in our dada, or joint distributions of two variables.


**Coming soon**: Multi-survey graph for some of the interesting questions


You can find the project on [Github](https://github.com/YochayCO/ines-website)
